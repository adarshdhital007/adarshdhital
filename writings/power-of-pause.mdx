<InteractiveParagraph
  text="In those moments when dreaming feels like it’s on pause, there’s this strange sense of attunement—like the mist finally clears, and everything that was out of focus starts to emerge, making you want to recalibrate everything you thought you understood."
  definitions={{
    attunement: "A harmonious or responsive connection.",
    mist: "A fine spray or light fog, often symbolic of obscurity.",
  }}
