When everything seems to be happening in a rush all at once, patience has become one of my most important skills. A lot of people are in such a rush and expect to see their desired results so quickly, yet for me appreciating the slowness has been very beautiful. I do believe that my patience goes beyond time. 

I actually enjoy having patience because it keeps me present, allows my feet to stay on the ground below [not above as much], helps guide me through life so gracefully and deliberately decisions are made. Years of practice have taught me that good things do come to those who wait, and that sometimes the journey is just as sweet as arriving at the destination.
