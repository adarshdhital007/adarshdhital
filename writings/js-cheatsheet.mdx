### Array Methods

- map(): Creates a new array with the results of a function.

```javascript
let arr = [1, 2];
arr.map((x = x * 2)); // logs [2,4]
```

- filter(): Creates a new array with elements that pass a test.

```javascript
let arr = [1, 2, 3];
arr.filter((x) => x > 1); // logs [2,3]
```

- reduce(): Reduces array to a single value using a function.

```javascript
let arr = [1, 2];
arr.reduce((a, b) => a + b); // logs 3
```

- find(): Returns the first element that passes a test

```javascript
let arr = [1, 2, 3];
arr.find((x) => x > 1); // logs [2] because 2 is greatest first value.
```

- findIndex(): Returns the index of the first element that passes a test.

```javascript   
let arr = [1, 2, 3];
arr.findIndex((x) => x > 1); // logs 1, which is index of 2.
```
