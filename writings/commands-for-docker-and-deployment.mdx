## Dockerize

To deploy an Angular website using Docker, follow these steps:

### Steps

Create a **Dockerfile** in the root of your Angular project.

```dockerfile
# Stage 1: Build the Angular application
FROM node:20.5.1 as node
WORKDIR /app
COPY . .
RUN npm install --force
RUN npm run build --prod

# Stage 2: Serve the application using Nginx
FROM nginx:alpine
COPY --from=node /app/angular-web /usr/share/nginx/html
```

```bash
# Build the docker container
docker build -t my-angular-web-app .
```

```bash
# Run the docker container now
docker run -d -p 80:80 my-angular-app
```

## Deploying Using WinSCP and PuTTY

I currently use WinSCP for file transfer and PuTTY for running commands. Here's how you can do it:

### Transfer Files with WinSCP

WinSCP is a tool that lets you transfer files between your computer and a remote server.

1. **Download and Install WinSCP:**

   - Download it from [WinSCP's official website](https://winscp.net).

2. **Connect to Your Server:**

   - Open WinSCP and enter your server's hostname (or IP address), username, and password.
   - Make sure to use the default SFTP protocol.
   - Also PPK (PuTTY Private Key) is mandatory.

3. **Transfer Your Files:**
   - On the left side of WinSCP, you'll see your local files. On the right side, you'll see your server files.
   - After creating .tar, file we drag the file into our remote server.

### Run Commands with PuTTY

PuTTY is a tool that lets you remotely access your server's command line interface.

1. **Download and Install PuTTY:**

   - Download it from [PuTTY's official website](https://www.putty.org).

2. **Connect to Your Server:**

   - Open PuTTY and enter your server's hostname (or IP address) and port (usually 22).
   - Click "Open" to start the session.
   - Log in with your username and password.

**Kill the running processes**

   ```bash
   # view the running processes
   docker ps
   ```

   ```bash
   # stop the desired container
   docker stop -p containerId
   ```

**Kill the running images**

   ```bash
   # First, view the running images
   docker images
   ```

   ```bash
   # Next, stop the desired image container id:
   docker rmi containerId # -f if it does not let you remove it.
   ```

**Load the tar, unextract it and deploy**
   ```bash
   # load the tar
   docker load -i /path/to/my-image.tar
   ```
   ```bash
   # run the desired container
   docker run -dp  80:80 project my-image .
   ```

## Creating build for React Native

Navigate to android directory.

```bash
# first clean
./gradlew clean
```

```bash
# then create apk
./gradlew assembleRelease
```

The APK will now be created at **android/app/build/outputs/apk/release/*.apk**

Add more commands as soon as I find something that's really important.
