### Reflections Should Be Dim

I've always loved the calmness that comes with darkness. Maybe it's because my most productive hours are late at night, when everything feels quieter and more introspective. Dark mode on my devices mimics that tranquility.

Dark mode has become more than just a visual preference. By inverting the traditional color scheme, dark mode reduces eye strain and conserves battery life, but its appeal extends beyond practicality.

Everyone has their own opinion on this, but I feel that most people prefer dark mode over light. When we're tired and using a mobile device, a light mode can keep our brain active and alert. In contrast, switching to dark mode helps our brain relax and feel sleepy. It's like choosing a path less illuminated, opting for a setting that feels more aligned with my natural rhythm.

### Finding Common Ground

So, what connects my love for dark mode with my fascination for owls? It's this shared sense of comfort and intrigue that comes from embracing the darkness.

In a way, dark mode on my screen and the silent flight of an owl both provide a sanctuary. They invite me to slow down, to embrace the quieter moments, and to find beauty in the less obvious places. They offer a personal comfort and inspiration in the more subtle, shadowy corners of life.
